## Write a short comment describing this function

## The following functions can create matrix which will cache its inverse
## for quick "calculation" in future calls.

## Make a matrix which can store a value for its inverse
## instead of solving for it every time.
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        s <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                s <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setsolve <- function(solve) s <<- solve
        getsolve <- function() s
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setsolve = setsolve,
             getsolve = getsolve)
}
